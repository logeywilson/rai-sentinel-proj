## Description

This project has taken on the task of detecting the presence of floodwater in Sentinel-1 global synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. Flooding is the most frequent and costly natural disaster in the US! High resolution SAR imaging has strengthened monitoring systems by providing data in otherwise inaccessible areas at frequent time intervals. Improving accuracy has the potential for strengthening early warning systems, risk assessment, and target relief.

## Objective

Bin Yu and Rebecca L. Barter's book [Veridical Data Science]("https://vdsbook.com/") is an excellent resource for those seeking to learn more about how to employ the full data science life cycle (DSLC) when approaching a problem. The goal of this project is for two non-data scientists to practice the implementation of the methods explored in the book on a real-world problem. Since domain knowledge was lacking we leaned heavily on previous work done by
