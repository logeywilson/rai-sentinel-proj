# RAI - Sentinel SAR Floodwater Detection

## Description

This project has taken on the task of detecting the presence of floodwater in Sentinel-1 global synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. Flooding is the most frequent and costly natural disaster in the US! High resolution SAR imaging has strengthened monitoring systems by providing data in otherwise inaccessible areas at frequent time intervals. Improving accuracy has the potential for strengthening early warning systems, risk assessment, and target relief.
